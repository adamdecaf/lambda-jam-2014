# Live-Coding the World

## Context

* Live coding real-time systems
* RT connected to the build env
* audio signal processing
  * computationally intensive
  * hard-real time (can't afford to "catch up" in later cycles)

## Live coding _in_ the World

* Programming is a journey
* Steering an algo over time
* programmer is situated in the environment also
* cyber-physical coupling - sense perceptions

## Controlling analog devices

* We can also write programs to not only create digital sounds, but analog
  * Controlling grand pianos with microphones relaying sound through speakers

## Notes

* Lookup electronic musicians
